This is a simple top down shooter that I wrote to teach myself unity's multiplayer sdk.

If you want to try it you can download the zip from the releases.
Unzip anywhere and run the .exe

It will have glitches and will not be able to connect without port forwarding.
You can try using the automatic Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) button but there is a good chance it won't work.
Other wise you will have to setup port forwarding yourself.

The top port number is the port used for both the client connecting and the host listening.
use "network info" to find your public IP address.

Click the red and blue buttons to switch teams.
